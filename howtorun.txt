How to run: 

1. Make sure MPI is included in path by running the following two commands: 
	"export MPJ_HOME=libs/mpj-v0_44"
	"export PATH=$MPJ_HOME/bin:$PATH"
	
2. Recompile the project by running: 
	"mvn clean install"
	
3. Run the compiled file with MPI (change parameters accordingly):
	"libs/mpj-v0_44/bin/mpjrun.sh -np 4 -cp target/HeatDistributed-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.mihastih.HeatDistributed width 1024 height 1024 points 10"
	
You are done....once it finishes running.
